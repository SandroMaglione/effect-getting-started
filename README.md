# How to `effect`
This is a collection of examples of how to use [`effect`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect).

This is an exploration of **all** (eventually) the features offered by `effect`.

## How to use
Install:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then you can run each script (take a look at `package.json` for the list of all the scripts you can run):

```bash
pnpm run index
```

> **Note**: The convention is that files that start with a lowercase letter are runnable scripts
